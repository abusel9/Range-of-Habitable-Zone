How Spectral Types Affect Habitable Zones

This project aims to explore habitable zones in planetary systems and their relationship to the mass and radius of host stars. By identifying Earth-like exoplanets within these zones, the project contributes to our understanding of extraterrestrial life and the evolution of the universe.

The hypothesis of the project posits a direct correlation between habitable zone range and the mass and radius of host stars. To investigate this, a dataset of planetary systems from the NASA Exoplanet Archive is analyzed using various data analysis techniques.

The data analysis involves calculating habitable zones, assigning spectral types to stars, approximating elliptical orbits as circular, and determining which planets fall within habitable zones. Furthermore, habitable zone ranges are plotted against stellar mass and radius to assess their relationship.

The project's findings reveal a dependence of habitable zone range on the spectral type of the host star. Hotter stars tend to have larger habitable zone ranges, although this correlation is not evident for G-type stars. Additionally, the distance of the habitable zone shows a positive correlation with stellar mass and radius.

In conclusion, the research supports the notion that habitable zones are influenced by the characteristics of the host star. The findings highlight the importance of considering spectral type and stellar mass when searching for potentially habitable exoplanets.

This project showcases skills in data analysis, hypothesis formulation, and drawing meaningful conclusions from astronomical datasets. It contributes to the ongoing exploration of habitable exoplanets and advances our understanding of the conditions necessary for life beyond Earth.
